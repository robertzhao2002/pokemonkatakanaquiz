# Pokémon Katakana Quiz #

This project was built using the BeautifulSoup4 Python library. It was used to retrieve the most recent Pokémon name, Pokédex number, and Katakana Name. The purpose of this project is to use Pokémon names (which are all in Japanese Katakana) to practice reading and recognizing Japanese Katakana characters. For implementation details, check `__init.py__` in the `QuizBuilder` module.
